Overview

This repository was created to document and share solutions to recurring coding challenges I encounteredâ€”whether during take-home projects for investment-related job interviews or while developing tools to manage my own portfolio using quantitative methods.

It showcases sample code that applies mathematical models and programming techniques to solve real-world investment problems. If you're exploring what quantitative investing entails or preparing for roles in the space, this may serve as a helpful reference.

Note: As with any technology-driven approach, results are only as good as the inputs and assumptions. Use with care and critical judgment.
