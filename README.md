Overview

This repository was created to document and share solutions that I created from scratch for recurring coding challenges I encounteredâ€”whether during academic research, trading competitions, take-home projects for investment-related job interviews or while developing tools to manage my own assets using quantitative methods.

It showcases sample code that applies mathematical models and programming techniques to solve real-world investment problems. If you're exploring what quantitative investing entails or preparing for roles in the space, this may serve as a helpful reference.

Note: As with any technology-driven approach, results are only as good as the input data and assumptions. Use with care and critical judgment.

Also note: This repository does not include any code related to proprietary signals or trading strategies.
